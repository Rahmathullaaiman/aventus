# Chat App
This Node.js application provides secure user authentication with JWT, enabling users to register and log in safely. It features a real-time messaging system that allows users to send messages to individuals and groups using WebSockets. Users can create and manage group chats, including adding or removing members and modifying group settings. Data is stored in a relational or NoSQL database, designed for efficient access to user and message information. The application prioritizes security by encrypting communications and protecting user data. Robust error handling ensures smooth user interactions, while unit tests verify the functionality of the backend. Performance optimization strategies are implemented to support a high volume of concurrent users and messages.
